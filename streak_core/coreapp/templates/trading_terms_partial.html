You are Solely Responsible for Input, Correctness, and Accuracy. The quality of the product's analysis and optimization depends on the user's inputs. After deployment, alerts have been made available in the product to ease and expedite your entry of the position, and you, as user of the system, are solely responsible for ensuring the quality of all its inputs. As such, you must carefully review all input parameters in all ways necessary to ensure their accuracy and fidelity. While there are other factors governing analysis and optimization accuracy, the quality of the product outputs depends on the accuracy of your inputs. The trades generated by the Service may increase beyond what is practical to execute, due to broker execution limits and the difficulties in executing a complex trade in an all-or-none fashion. Moreover, once the trade is executed, the management of a complex trade becomes more difficult than is normally the case. Another factor is that you may not be authorized to execute all contract types found in the solutions generated. Streak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. makes no representation that a solution generated by the Service can be executed and effectively monitored and managed in practice. It is entirely your responsibility to assess the appropriateness, suitability, and practicality of the solutions generated by the optimizer.

In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading Strategies in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific Strategies trading  which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.<br>
Chart data is subjected to minor variations from market time to post market times due to standard data adjustments.

					<h1>METHODOLOGY</h1>

					<p class="warning">Disclaimer: Backtesting performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</p>

					<p>Backtesting results are hypothetical and are simulated on historical data. The performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record, these results do not represent actual trading. These trades have not actually been executed and the results may have been under-or over-compensated for the impact especially when we have lack of liquidity in the market or news driven events or due to any other conditions. Simulated or hypothetical trading strategies in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those backtested.</p>
					<p>In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading strategy in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific strategy trade  which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.</p>

					<!-- <h1>ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS USED WHILE CALCULATING RESULTS</h1>

					<p><span class="bold">Candle Intervals</span> define the time frame of each candle interval. We calculate the backtest result for any trading strategy on our site, hypothetical results are based on the assumption that you invested the starting amount shown on the strategy’s performance chart. In some cases, nominal dollar amounts on the equity chart have been re-scaled downward to make current go-forward trading sizes more manageable. In these cases, it may not have been possible to trade the strategy historically at the equity levels shown on the chart, and a higher minimum capital was required in the past.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">All fees are included</span> When calculating cumulative returns, we try to estimate and include all the fees a typical trader incurs when AutoTrading using AutoTrade technology. This includes the subscription cost of the strategy, plus any per-trade AutoTrade fees, plus estimated broker commissions if any. Autotrade fees are $99/month. Subscription fees are set by the system manager, published on each system summary page, and range from $20-$200/month. Brokerage commissions are set by the individual brokers and subscribers may view performance based on the current available commission rates and structures under the ‘Statistics’ section of the System Page.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">“Max Drawdown” Calculation Method</span> We calculate the Max Drawdown statistic as follows. Our computer software looks at the equity chart of the system in question and finds the largest percentage amount that the equity chart ever declines from a local “peak” to a subsequent point in time (thus this is formally called “Maximum Peak to Valley Drawdown.”) While this is useful information when evaluating trading systems, you should keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results. Therefore, future drawdowns may be larger than the historical maximum drawdowns you see here.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Profits are reinvested</span> We assume profits (when there are profits) are reinvested in the trading strategy.</p>

					<h1>TRADING IS RISKY</h1>

					<p>There is a substantial risk of loss in futures and forex trading. Online trading of stocks and options is extremely risky. Assume you will lose money. Don’t trade with money you cannot afford to lose.</p>
 -->
 					<h1>ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS USED WHEN CREATING ALGO</h1>
 					<h2>Creating an strategy</h2>
 					<p>"Create" is a process to input entry and exit conditions involving technical indicators, stop loss percentage, take profit percentage, instrument, quantity of stocks etc and form a trading strategy, hereafter referred to as "trading strategy" or "strategy" or "strategies".<br><br>
 					An "strategy" on Streak is defined as a collection of conditions and input parameters entered by the user which determines the generation of a trade signal based on the stock movement.</p>
 					<h3>Entry</h3>
 					<p>Entry condition forms a logical point to generate an entry signal to take a position. Entry condition can comprise of one or more individual conditions which must be logically "true" to generate signal. An individual condition is created by comparing one value/parameter/indicator with another value/parameter/indicator,<br>
 					ex: 20 SMA (indicator) higher than (>) 10 SMA, <br>
 					here, we see that the condition will be logically True when the value of '20 SMA' is more than value of '10 SMA'. Upto 3 conditions can be combined together to generate a trading signal. The generation of a trading signal is determined by the combined logical combination of the conditions being true for the current candle and it being false in previous candle.</p>

 					<p><span class="bold">Creating  an entry signal</span><br>An entry signal is made up of multiple conditions. An entry signal must have at least one condition.<br><br>
 					<span class="bold">Forming a condition</span> Each individual condition in a trading strategy has 3 parts:<br>
					1. Indicator1 - A value such as a technical indicator, price, volume.<br>
					2. Comparator - a logical comparator such as higher than, lower than etc.<br>
					3. Indicator2 - Something to compare Indicator1 with, a value such as a technical indicator, price, volume.<br><br>

					These 3 parts together form one condition in an strategy. An strategy can have multiple conditions and must have at least one condition.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Combining Conditions (with "AND"/"OR")</span><br>
					When a trading strategy has multiple conditions, these conditions are combined together using "AND"/"OR" to collectively form a single strategy with a single entry point event.<br>The output of the combination of your conditions is based on digital logic operations.</p>

					<h3>Exit</h3>
 					<p>Exit condition defines the point at which a position can be exited. An exit condition is defined by a target stop loss percentage and a target take profit percentage. After the strategy enters a position, the target stop loss price and the target take price is calculated on the average price of the entry order.<br><br>
 					<span class="">Note:</span><br><br>
 					<span class="">1. During a backtest, if the close price crosses either of the exit prices point in the current candle, the hypothetical exit order is placed on the close price of the next candle.</span><br><br>
 					<span class="">2. For live strategies (after an strategy is deployed), if the the strategy has entered a position in the market, if the LTP (last traded price) crosses either of the exit prices point, an actionable alert is sent to the user on which they can manual click on "buy/sell" to place a market order in the exchange.</span>
 					</p>

 					<p><span class="bold">Scrip/Instrument</span> is the equity or future contract on which users can run the backtest and deploy the strategy.<br><br>
 					<span class="bold">Position</span> allows users to define the entry type (i.e. buy/sell) and the quantity of stocks to be used by the strategy.</p>


					<h1>ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS USED WHILE CALCULATING BACKTEST RESULTS</h1>

					<p>Backtesting on Streak, allows users to measure the hypothetical performance and returns of strategies on historical market data of stock or contracts. All backtest results are a hypothetical representation of the performance and returns on an strategy, based on some underlying assumptions (listed in the section below). These results do not provide any guarantee of future performance or returns, and all strategies are subjected to market risks. The backtest page allows users to adjust and modify various input parameters which are used run a backtest. These parameters have been described below.</p>

					<h2>Backtest input parameters</h2>

					<p><span class="bold">Initial capital</span> represents the maximum capital allocated for the backtest of each equity/futures contract. This capital does not represent any capital held by the user and is for backtest purposes only. Initial capital acts as the maximum capital that will be used by the strategy during a backtest to perform hypothetical trades.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Quantity</span> represents the trading quantity to be used by the strategy. Quantity is a positive integer with defined absolute position size of an order, using which the strategy performs hypothetical trades during the backtest. After the backtest is run with a quantity, the same quantity value is used when the strategy is deployed.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Stop loss percentage</span> is the value used to calculate the stop loss price once the hypothetical entry position has been taken. An exit trigger is generated if the price hits/crosses the calculated stop loss price and the positions will be hypothetically exited at the close price of the subsequent candle.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Target profit percentage</span> is the value used by strategy to calculate the target profit price once the hypothetical entry position has been taken. An exit trigger is generated if the price hits/crosses the calculated target profit price and the positions will be hypothetically exited at the close price of the subsequent candle.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Order type</span> can be MIS or CNC/NRML and represents the order type used to place hypothetical orders in a backtest. MIS is used for intraday margin trading, where the order will get squared off during the market close. CNC/NRML is used for overnight trading, where the stock/contract is held after the market close and can be carried forward to the next day. If CNC/NRML has been selected the order type, CNC will be used as the order type for equities and NRML for futures contracts, based on the tick symbol and instrument segment.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Candle Interval</span> is defined as the time frame of each candle interval. All backtest calculations are made using the close price of the selected candle interval.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Backtest period</span> is the lookback period to perform a backtest and is defined by slecting the start and stop date for the backtest. Backtest period can be modified to re-run backtests; however there are some backtest period ranges that are limited based on the candle period such as:<br><br>
					For a min candle interval, the maximum backtest period is 1 month and the lookback date cannot be older than 30 days prior to the current date, i.e., user cannot select a start/stop date older than 30 days.<br><br>
					For an hour candle interval, the maximum backtest period is one year and the lookback date cannot be older than one year prior to the current date, i.e., user cannot select a start/stop date older than one year.<br><br>
					For a day candle interval, the maximum backtest period is five years and the lookback date cannot be older than five years prior to the current date, i.e., user cannot select a start/stop date older than five years.<br><br>
					These limits are subject to change based on the availability of data. The backtest period and the data fetched is also subjected to technical limitations such as bandwidth, data availability, server load and various or technical implications.</p>

					<p><span class="bold">Equities/future contracts</span> can be added/removed on the backtest page. Backtests are run individually for every equity/contract that has been added; therefore the backtest counter is updated to reflect this. For example: if 5 equities have been added and backtest is run, the counter will be updated as 5 backtests run. If no new equities/contracts have been added and backtest is run, the backtests are re-run on all the equities/contracts irrespective of its previous status.</p>

					<p><!-- <span class="bold"></span>  -->On clicking the "Run backtest" button, a fresh backtest is run for each equity/contract by first fetching all the appropriate historical market data for the respective stock/contract and initializing all the user defined parameters. The historical market data is then processed to generate hypothetical trade signals and hypothetical trades are performed using the hypothetical initial capital.<br>
					Based on these hypothetical trades, certain performance metrics such as hypothetical profit/loss, winning streak, losing streak etc are generated in an effort to provide a generalised and simplified understanding of the strategy’s hypothetical returns and risk. All the hypothetical trades generated are shown in the transactions table along with profit/loss and portfolio values during every trade.<br>
					The results of all the backtest are hypothetical and do not guarantee or portray in any form or manner any future performance or returns. The backtest results are a hypothetical representation of strategy’s performance and do not provide any guarantee to accuracy in data and are subjects to technical accuracy limitations like rounding off, memory buffer limits, user's browser and system limitations.</p>

					<h2>Backtest assumptions</h2>

					<p><!-- <span class="bold">Backtest assumptions:</span>  -->During a backtest, hypothetical trades are generated with the following high level assumptions:<br><br>
					1. During backtest, irrespective of the order type, no margins as assumed for any instrument. The user must enter the desired initial capital value such that it is higher than the product of quantity and the instruments close price (initial capital >= (quantity x close price)).<br><br>
					2. During a backtest, any hypothetical signal to buy or sell is executed on the close of next candle irrespective of the actual volumes traded for that candle in the historical data. It can be considered as the maximum slippage.<br><br>
					3. During a backtest, no form of averaging is done i.e., the strategy does not take multiple consecutive entry positions before exiting the current position (entry position is taken only after the previous position has been exited i.e., when quantity at hand is zero).<br><br>
					4. During a backtest, the strategy only exists when either the target profit price or stop loss price is hit.<br><br>
					5. During a backtest, there is no context nor is any consideration given to corporate actions such as stock splits, rights issues etc and no adjustments are made to stock/contract prices. The values OHLCV (Open , High, Low, Close and Volume) are taken directly as present in the historical candle data.<br><br>
					6. During a backtest, a hypothetical buy signal is generated only if the condition is false in the previous candle and is true in the current candle.<br><br>
					7. During a backtest the usage of Open, High, Low, Close is very specific to the candle OHLCV actually going higher lower or than the comparison value.<br><br>
					8. During a backtest the profit/loss and the PNL chart values are calculated on the Close price of every candle when a position is held.<br><br>
					9. During a backtest, if the order type is MIS, all open positions are hypothetically squared off at the open price of 3:15 pm candle, this is done to simulate a square offs done by the brokers for MIS orders.</p>

					<h2>Backtest error messages</h2>

					<p><!-- <span class="bold">Backtest error messages:</span> -->During a backtest, if any error occurs/proper results are not be generated, we try to show an appropriate message to help the user adjust the input parameters and run the backtest again. These error messages are explained below:<br><br>
					1. "No trades happened" - This means that no hypothetical entry signals were generated for the strategy and no hypothetical trades were performed for the backtest period selected by the user.  This could mean that the strategy conditions were never met in the specified backtest period or that the conditions are syntactically/logically incorrect or are not expressed properly with the right indicator parameters.<br><br>
					2. "No trades happened because initial capital is low" - This means that the strategy conditions were met and trading signals were generated but due to insufficient hypothetical initial capital, hypothetical trades were not generated. It can be resolved by increasing the hypothetical initial capital or by decreasing the quantity and running the backtest agian.<br><br>
					3. "Error while fetching data" - This means that an internal error occured while fetching historical data. It can be resolved by waiting for a few minutes and running the backtest again.<br><br>
					4. Server timed out - This means that the user's browser is not able to connect to Streak servers due to internet connection error. It can be resolved by checking the internet connection and running the backtest again.</p>

					<!-- <p><span class="bold">Anomalies:</span> During a backtest, and any anomalies in backtest data is not adjusted for, so backtest will not take in account any stock splits, dividend or stock issued or any other market event. During backtest, strategy strictly relies on the OHLCV historical candle data to perform hypothetical trades and generate hypothetical performance and returns and various other metrics.</p> -->

					<h1>ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCESS DURING DEPLOY</h1>

					<h2>Deployment process and disclaimer</h2>

					<p><!-- <span class="bold">Deployment process and disclaimer:</span>   -->Deploy allows users to take their strategies live in stock market and to get actionable alerts based on the entry and exit conditions in their strategy.<br>
					On clicking the "Deploy" button in either the "Backtest" page or "Strategies" page, a popup is rendered with a summary of the user's strategy with the entry condition, exit condition and candle interval. The user also selects the field "Algo live for", which determines the period for which the strategy will be live and our systems will track market movements. If "Intraday" is selected, the order type will be MIS and the strategy will be live for that single day; if the user selects "Overnight", the order type will be CNC for equities and NRML for future contracts and the strategy will be live for the next 30 days (or until the strategy is stopped by the user or terminated due to some reason such as order rejection).<br>
					By clicking on "Confirm", <!-- users agrees the terms of service and the disclaimer mentioned above the deploy button and completely understands the uncertainty and risk that trading and internet services hold.  --> the strategy is taken live and our systems start tracking the market and periodically check for any signals being generated by the strategy based on the entry and exit conditions in the strategy.<br>
					Once a signal is generated, we try to send this signal to the user's device over the internet. The delivery of these alerts are subject to network conditions of the user, internet services and technical issues.<br><br>
					Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the success of strategyic trading. Our service providers or systems that provide data could experience failures, errors, lag and latency, which could result in missing, incorrect, or stale market data leading to no/wrong signals(alert) and triggering an alert.<br>
					<!-- During deploy, user can selected the Algo once deployed starts waiting for the entry signal and waits for the first trigger event. Once the first signal is generated the actionable alerts are send and based on users actions various other alerts generated and an attempt is made to send it the user to notify the state of the strategy or the strategy(more details on this in strategy deployment lifecycle below). --></p>

					<h2>Algo deployment lifecycle</h2>
					<p><!-- <span class="bold">Algo deployment lifecycle:</span>  -->Once an strategy is deployed, the stocks are periodically tracked based on the conditions in the strategy. The periodicity with which the market is tracked is the same as the candle interval selected by the user while backtesting the strategy and shown in the strategy summary before deployment. An strategy's ideal life cycle and the tree of events that can occur during an strategy's life cycle, called an "strategy loop", has been explained below: </p>

					<p>1. Waits for the first entry event as per the entry condition in the deployed strategy.<br><br>
					2. Once the entry event occurs, a entry signal (buy/sell) is triggered and an actionable alert is sent to the user.<br><br>
					3. The user can choose to act on the alert by clicking buy/sell or choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancel will terminate the strategy).<br><br>
					4. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market order is sent to the exchange (NSE).<br><br>
					5. The order will either be successfully placed by the exchange or it might get rejected due to resons such as insufficient capital. If the order gets rejected by the exchange, the strategy gets terminated.<br><br>
					6. After the successful placement of an order, the strategy continues to track the stock waiting for the exit signal (SL or TP). Based on the entry price and the SL and TP percentages entered by the user, the SL and TP prices are calculated which are displayed to the user.<br><br>
					7. When the SL or TP price occurs, an actionable notification is sent to the user again. The user can then chose to act on it bu clicking buy/sell or choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancel will terminate the strategy).<br><br>
					8. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market order is sent to the exchange (NSE) and the strategy's life cycle is now complete.<!--  and moves to a 'complete' state. --><br><br>
					<!-- 9. The cycle (steps 1 to 8) repeats for a second <br><br> -->
					<span class="">Note:</span><br><br>
					<span class="">1. The "strategy loop" sequence defined above is an ideal sequence and is subject to market conditions and user behaviour. Based on the user's action or market conditions, the sequence might not completely occur in the same way as it is intended to, since this sequence may have been interrupted due to various reasons such as, user stopping the strategy, order rejection by the exchange, network lag, network error etc.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">2. For both intraday and overnight strategies, the strategy is looped twice (steps 1 to 9 are executed twice) after which the strategy moves to a 'complete' state and is stopped.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">3. Margins are not blocked till the user acts on the actionable alerts (buy/sell) and the order is sent to the exchange.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">4.The strategy can be stopped by the user at any time in the life cycle of the strategy by clicking on the "Stop" button. If the strategy has not entered a position, it will be directly stopped otherwise the user will be presented with an option to either stop the strategy by keeping the positions open or to exit positions at market and stop the strategy. The strategy will no longer be tracked and no further alerts will be sent to the user for the respective strategy.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">5. In cases where the user stops the strategy and chooses to keep positions open, the responsibility of closing any and all positions is solely on the user, and user will get no alerts for that deployed instrument once the strategy is stopped.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">6. For order type MIS, all strategies will be stopped at 3:20 pm and the open positions, if any, will be squared off by the respective broker (example, Zerodha) before market close.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">7. All actionable order alerts sent to the user can be used only once and will be active for only 5 minutes after which the alert expires and the strategy is terminated.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">8. All actionable alert orders are market orders and users can expect price variation from the price at which the alert was triggered to the price at which the the order is placed.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">9. If the user's order is rejected due to various reasons such as shortage of funds, circuit limit hit, no liquidity in market, etc, the strategy will be stopped and no further alerts will be sent for that strategy. This is done in order to avoid unnecessary tracking of instruments where the order placement failed. However, the user can deploy the strategy again, and take action on any new alerts that get generated.</span><br><br>
					<span class="">10. Target profit and stop loss orders are not placed with the entry order. The strategy tracks the stock for the stop loss and take profit prices only after entering a position. Once the stop loss or take profit price occurs, an actionable alert is sent to the user and once the user confirms to exit, the exit order (stop loss or take profit order) is placed at the exchange.</span><br><br>

			<!-- 		<p><span class="bold">Deploy assumptions:</span> Once an strategy is deployed, the following process assumptions are made by the strategy in its live state:</p> -->

					<!-- <p>Once the strategy is deployed, user can see the currently live strategies on deployed page and on Algo page. On the deployed page user is presented with the latest state of the strategy is currently in. The P&L show here is the current profit/loss of the users positions taken only by acting on strategy’s actionable alerts. All the actionable alerts are MARKET order, and are read only, upon clicking Buy/Sell a market order is placed with the details shown in the notification. If multiple strategy’s are deployed on the same equity/contract, the position and P&L are calculated and displayed individually for each strategy, the stop loss(SP) and target profit(TP) is shown for live strategies, where the user have taken a position and the strategy is waiting for exit opportunity. It very important for the users to note that, the stop loss and target profit prices are calculated on the last entry order’s average price and stop loss and target profit percentage in the strategy, and for these stop loss and target profit prices an order has not been placed, till the prices have reached and the users takes action on the take profit and stop loss alert. Once the target profit or stop loss prices have been reached the strategy will try to send user the exit position alert, with prefilled order details using which user can exit the positions taken only by that individual strategy.</p> -->

					<!-- <p><span class="bold">Anomalies:</span> During a backtest, and any anomalies in backtest data is not adjusted for, so backtest will not take in account any stock splits, dividend or stock issued or any other market event. During backtest, strategy strictly relies on the OHLCV historical candle data to perform hypothetical trades and generate hypothetical performance and returns and various other metrics.</p> -->

					<h1>ALGO ALERTS:</h1>
					<p>Once the strategy is live and an alert is generated based on the conditions in the strategy, our systems attempt to deliver the alert to the user over the internet. By using this service, the user acknowledges they understand that the alerts' delivery is dependent on many factors such as the internet connection of the user, location, time of the day, server load, data availability, etc.<br>
					We advice users to be logged in to streak.tech, keep it open in their browser and maintain an uninterrupted fast internet connection to their devices to see the best alerts delivery. <!-- At Streak we make it our highest priority to generate and deliver timely alerts to the user, however the accuracy and timely delivery can by effected by user's internet conditions, user's location, user’s device conditions, browsers and various other user side technical factors, overall internet connectivity in the region, traffic and load to Streak servers. --><br>
					All actionable order alerts are read only market order alerts, where with a single click user can send the order to the exchange. The actionable order alerts are made read only in order to obtain consistency in the deployed and backtest results and to avoid any drastic increase in risk.<br>
					Upon clicking on buy/sell on the order window, based on users network speed, a network latency can be experienced, and any rapid clicks on the buy/sell button through same or different windows can lead to multiple order placements. Users take full responsibility on making sure the actions on the notifications are their own actions and are fully aware of their positions  and strategy status when on the buy/sell button.

a. Streak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Streak.tech)’s software/code might fail to work properly.<br>
i. All software is subject to inadvertent programming errors and bugs embedded in the code comprising that software. Any of these errors and bugs can cause the software in which they are located to fail or not work properly. The applications software used to operate Streak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Streak.tech)’s Site and Services depends is subject to this risk. Despite testing and on-going monitoring and maintenance, inadvertent errors and bugs may still cause a failure inStreak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Streak.tech)’s applications software.<br>

</p>
<h2>Risks in Create, Backtest, and Deploying Strategies (Algorithms)</h2>
<p>
Creating, backtesting, and deploying computer-based trading strategies is subject to several risks, any of which can cause your strategies to not function as you had intended or fail to achieve one or more of the objectives of your strategies. Algorithmic trading is rapidly changing as a practice and as an industry. Models of markets used to write and test trading strategies are inherently limited and often fail to perform as expected. In addition, trading strategies are implemented in software programming code, and no matter how well designed and thoroughly tested, any such code can have logical errors and bugs that cause the strategies to malfunction or suggest trades that, if executed, would result in losses. It is your obligation to thoroughly and appropriately test any trading strategy before you deploy it and to continually monitor the operation of any deployed trading strategy to ensure it is running properly and in compliance with any applicable rules<br>
a. Your strategy may be designed on the basis of an incorrect understanding of technical indicators which may not work as expected.<br>
b. Your strategy may contain logical errors in the way you understand the indicators and comparators.<br>
c. Errors may exist in the data used for testing your strategy or the applicable model of the market.<br>
d. Your strategy might appear to succeed in a backtesting environment using historical data, but fail when using live data.<br>
e. Your strategy might appear to succeed with some data sources, but fail when using other data sources in our system.<br>
f. Your strategy may not achieve the returns you anticipate. There are no guarantees, or even expectations, that can be made about the future behavior of an strategy.
</p>
<h2>Risks of Engaging in Live Algorithmic Trading and Related Strategies</h2>
<p>
Streak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Streak.tech) and Zerodha allows you to engage in live trading. Engaging in live trading subjects you to (a) the risks associated with trading generally, and (b) the risks associated with live strategyic trading using Streak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Streak.tech).<br><br>
THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OF THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ALL OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE DEPOSITED IN THE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT YOU USE FOR LIVE TRADING BASED ON THE STRATEGIES YOU WRITE, TEST, AND RUN ON Streak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Streak.tech). LOSSES CAN HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY WHEN USING STRATEGYIC TRADING THAN OTHER FORMS OF TRADING. YOU SHOULD DISCUSS WITH AN INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL THE RISKS OF TRADING IN GENERAL AND STRATEGYIC TRADING IN PARTICULAR. YOU USE ANY STRATEGY IN LIVE TRADING AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO THOROUGHLY AND APPROPRIATELY TEST ANY TRADING STRATEGY BEFORE YOU DEPLOY IT AND TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE OPERATION OF ANY DEPLOYED TRADING STRATEGY TO ENSURE IT IS RUNNING PROPERLY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE RULES.<br>
</p>
<!-- <h2>a. Risks of Trading, Generally</h2> -->
<h2>Certain Risks of Live Algorithmic Trading</h2>
<p>
In addition to all of the risks described above, live strategyic trading is subject to the following types of types of risk:
</p>
<h3>i. Backtesting Cannot Assure Actual Results.</h3>
<p>
It is not possible for a computer model to truly predict what might have happened if an strategy-based trading strategy was in play in a live trading environment. For example, the implementation of such a strategy can itself have an impact on the market, and the model may fail to account for real-life factors that impact the model. Moreover, the model may fail to account for execution costs including broker commissions, fees, and trading slippage.<br><br>
A promising model result does not necessarily predict a successful strategy. Execution of the  strategy and the performance of that code may prove to be impossible in a live trading environment. Changes in various market factors not foreseen in a model can change, causing a strategy to fail. A backtest might be over-fitted to past data, and fail when the strategy is applied to new, live data. Orders that were executed correctly in the backtesting environment may be disallowed or rejected because of various reasons eg: margin requirement , illiquid stocks etc causing the strategy to fail or otherwise not perform as expected. Attempts to create, exit, or cancel orders might fail, or might result in unexpected outcomes. Moreover, your strategy might not handle market conditions that cannot be reasonably anticipated, i.e., a “flash crash” or an exchange outage. These market conditions, by definition, will not have been tested.
</p>
<h3>ii. The relevant market might fail or behave unexpectedly.</h3>
<p>
Market centers in which you seeking to implement your trading strategy may fail or behave incorrectly because of technical reasons relating to infrastructure, connectivity, and similar factors.<br>
Your strategy might suffer from adverse market conditions. Those conditions can include lack of liquidity, and abrupt and unwarranted price swings. Also possible are late market openings, early market closings, market chaos, and mid-day trading pauses, and other such disruptive events.
</p>
<h3>iii. Your broker may experience failures in its infrastructure, fail to execute your orders in a correct or timely fashion or reject your orders.</h3>
<p>
Streak.tech infrastructure on which you are running your strategy might fail. In addition, even if Streak.tech infrastructure or your broker's infrastructure and API are working correctly, the orders may get rejected in error or by design, incorrectly execute orders, or induce errors through unexpected behavior (such as returning messages out of sequence, incorrectly acknowledging orders, or posting incorrect execution reports). If at all, any losses arise from these risks, Streak AI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Streak.tech) bears no responsibility for this.<br>
</p>
<h3>iv. The system you use for generating trading orders, communicating those orders to your broker, and receiving queries and trading results from your broker may fail or not function in a correct or timely manner.</h3>
<p>
Latency (i.e., delays) within and between your system, as well as those of your broker and the market in which you seeking to affect trades, might cause orders, corrections, and cancels to be placed or not placed in ways that are not desired. You may receive incorrect information, or be unable to get information, about your orders, your positions, or market conditions. Incorrect actions may be taken, or correct actions may not be taken, because of inaccurate or missing information. In addition, you may be unable to terminate or edit your strategy.
</p>
<h3>v. Time lag at various point in live trading might cause unexpected behavior.</h3>
<p> The time lag between the actionable alert generation time, the time at which you receive the actionable alert, and the time at which you take action on the alert, can cause a delayed order placement in the market, lead to cancellations, and cause you loss (or fail to gain profits) and may deliver unanticipated results vastly different from the backtest results.</p>
<h3>vi. The systems of third parties in addition to those of the provider from which we obtain various services, your broker, and the applicable securities market may fail or malfunction.</h3>
<p>
Algorithmic trading depends on the availability of various services from third parties in addition to your service provider and your broker. These, for example, include providers of data services, computational services, and network connectivity. The operations of these third parties are beyond all of our reasonable control. Regardless of the reason for any failure by your broker, the market in which you seek to have trades executed, or these other third parties, we will not have any liability for any such failure.<br>
Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the success of strategyic trading. The systems of these data providers could experience failures, errors, and latency, which could result in missing, incorrect, or stale market data.
</p>
<h3>vii. Malicious and criminal activities might cause your strategies and strategy to fail or your brokerage account to be compromised.</h3>
<p>
All computers and networks are subject to malicious “hacking” attacks and criminal activities designed to misappropriate intellectual property, compromise personally identifiable information, steal funds, or any combination of such purposes. These attacks might be attacks on a target of opportunity or specifically targeted. Each of the various systems described above that are necessary for you to engage in live strategyic trading is subject to such attack. Any such attack could cause the system so attacked to function improperly or not at all and could result in the misappropriation of your intellectual property, the compromise of your personally identifiable information and personal financial information, the theft of your funds and can cause your strategy be misbehave, malfunction or behave erratically.

<h1>Browser Notification</h1>
<p>The first time you login to Streak website, the web browser asks your permission to allow browser notification. Please allow the notification, else you won't be getting any alerts on your system when the strategy condition is met.</p>
<h1>Sample Strategies</h1>
<p>Users can check the sample strategies provided on the dashboard to understand the working of indicators and how to use them. Streak is not responsible for any profits/losses occurred after deploying sample strategies in the market.</p>
<h1>Algo alerts</h1>
<p>Once the strategy is live and an alert is generated based on the conditions in the strategy, our systems attempt to deliver the alert to the user over the internet. By using this service, the user acknowledges they understand that the alerts' delivery is dependent on many factors such as the internet connection of the user, location, time of the day, server load, data availability etc.<br>
We recommend  users to be logged in to streak.tech, keep it open in their browser and maintain a fast uninterrupted internet connection to their devices to see the best alerts delivery.<br>
Streak relies on <b>third party services for market data eg.  Kite (Zerodha Trading Platform) for ticks, OHLCV etc.</b> If these services are down due to unforeseen circumstances or experience a down time due to various technical / non technical issues, Streak might not be able to generate and deliver the actionable alerts on time or at all.<br><br>
Once a signal is generated, we try to send this signal to the user's device over the internet. The delivery of these alerts are subject to network conditions of the user, internet services and technical issues.<br><br>
Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the success of strategyic trading. Our service providers or systems that provide data could experience failures, errors, lag, and latency which could result in missing, incorrect, or stale market data leading to no/wrong signals(alert) while triggering an alert.<br><br>
All actionable order alerts are read-only market order alerts, where with a single click the user can send the order to the exchange. The actionable order alerts are made read-only in order to obtain consistency in the deployed and backtest results and to avoid any drastic increase in risk. If on any scrip / instruments such as Stock, Futures, Currency Futures etc., there is high volatility due to news based or non news based or any speculative events / positions, Streak is not responsible for higher slippages. You understand that volatility is the nature of the market.<br><br>
Upon clicking on buy/sell on the order window, based on users network speed, a network latency can be experienced and any rapid clicks on the buy/sell button through same or different windows can lead to multiple order placements. Users take full responsibility on making sure the actions on the notifications are their own actions and are fully aware of their positions and strategy status when clicking on the buy/sell button.

<h1>Algo deployment cycle / Algo Cycle</h1>
<p><b>The strategy cycle</b> Entry and respective exit of an strategy is defined as an strategy cycle.<br>
Once an strategy is deployed, the stocks are periodically tracked based on the conditions in the strategy. The periodicity with which the market is tracked is the same as the candle interval selected by the user while backtesting the strategy and shown in the strategy summary before deployment. An strategy's ideal life cycle and the tree of events that can occur during an strategy's life cycle, called an "strategy cycle", has been explained below:<br>
1. Waits for the first entry event as per the entry condition in the deployed section.<br>
2. Once the entry event occurs, a entry signal (buy/sell) is triggered and an actionable alert is sent to the user.<br>
3. The user can choose to act on the alert by clicking buy/sell or choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancelling from the notification window will terminate the strategy).<br>
4. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market order is sent to the exchange (NSE).<br>
5. The order will either be successfully placed by the exchange or it might get rejected due to reasons such as insufficient capital, etc. If the order gets rejected by the exchange, the strategy gets terminated. Streak does not verify the margin requirement, Kite determines the margin requirement as all orders are placed on Kite.<br>
6. After the successful placement of an order,  the strategy immediately triggers an SL-M order. This is a STOP LOSS order which the user can place or cancel. Canceling this order will NOT terminate the strategy and your positions will be open and if your Stop Loss is triggered later , then a notification is sent again to the user. (If you have already placed the SL-M order then if the SL hits first then this order will get executed and position is closed).<br>
7. The strategy continues to track the stock waiting for the exit signal (SL or TP) or exit condition. Based on the entry price and the SL and TP percentages entered by the user, the SL and TP prices are calculated which are displayed to the user in the Deployed Page Subsection ENTERED.<br>
8. When the SL/TP price occurs or if the exit condition is met, whichever occurs first, an actionable notification is sent to the user again. The user can then chose to act on it by clicking buy/sell or choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancel will terminate the strategy). <b>Note:</b> If you cancel the SL or TP alert from the notification/alerts page the strategy gets terminated. However, if you cancel the notification or alert from the order log in deployed page, the strategy is not terminated.
<br>
9. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market order is sent to the exchange (NSE) and the strategy's life cycle is now complete.<br>
10. The "strategy cycle" sequence defined above is an ideal sequence and is subject to market conditions and user behaviour. Based on the user's action or market conditions, the sequence might not completely occur in the same way as it is intended to, since this sequence may have been interrupted due to various reasons such as, the user stopping the strategy, order rejection by the exchange, network lag, network error etc.<br>
11. For both intraday and overnight strategies, the strategy cycle has to be defined by the user during deployment. Depending on the number of strategy cycles, the strategy moves to a 'complete' state and is stopped.<br>
12. Margins are not blocked till the user acts on the actionable alerts (buy/sell) and the order is sent to the exchange.<br>
13.The strategy can be stopped by the user at any time in the life cycle of the strategy by clicking on the "Stop" button. If the strategy has not entered a position, it will be directly stopped otherwise the user will be presented with an option to either stop the strategy by keeping the positions open or to exit positions at market and stop the strategy. The strategy will no longer be tracked and no further alerts will be sent to the user for the respective strategy.<br>
14. In cases where the user stops the strategy and chooses to keep positions open, the responsibility of closing any and all positions is solely on the user, and user will get no alerts for that deployed instrument once the strategy is stopped. <br>
15. For order type MIS, all strategies will be stopped at 3:20 PM (4:30 PM for currency futures) and the open positions, if any, will be squared off by the respective broker (example, Zerodha) before market close and charges for closure by kite is applied<br>
16. All actionable order alerts sent to the user can be used only once and will be active for only 5 minutes after which the alert expires in the notification/ alerts section. However, these alerts are actionable in the order log section of the Deployed Page.<br>
17. All actionable alert orders are market orders and users can expect price variation from the price at which the alert was triggered to the price at which the the order is placed. Slippages are expected to occur.<br>
18. If the user's order is rejected due to various reasons such as shortage of funds, circuit limit hit, no liquidity in market, etc, the strategy will be stopped and no further alerts will be sent for that strategy. This is done in order to avoid unnecessary tracking of instruments where the order placement failed. However, the user can deploy the strategy again and take action on any new alerts that get generated.<br>
<b>Currency futures</b> You can create, backtest and deploy currency futures in Streak. Each quantity corresponds to 1 lot size i.e, 1000. MIS strategies will be stopped at 4:30 PM and open positions, if any will be squared off.
